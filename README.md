# Python-task-for-BREAST-CANCER-PREDICTION-DATASET
# Introduction=
# A most common type of cancer, founded in women is breast cancer prediction. It originates from breast tissue.
# On the basis of the supplied feature set, the diagnosis is able to be classified as benign or malignant (cancer).

# Conclusion=
# The goal of this study was to develop a model that could determine if a tumour was benign or malignant depending # on the characteristics provided. With the given hyper-parameters, the SVC offered the highest accuracy rating.
# Additionally, we noticed that scaling the data enhanced the algorithm's performance for the test dataset. 
# Outliers can be eliminated as a following step to see if performance is improved or not.
# It is very unlikely to achieve 100% accuracy in any real-world problem, especially in a classification problem 
# where the data may have noise or overlapping features. There will always be some amount of error or  
# misclassification. Additionally, there may be limitations to the model, such as overfitting to the training data 
# or not being able to capture all the relevant information in the features. Therefore, it is important to aim for # high accuracy while also considering other performance metrics and ensuring the model is reliable and robust.
